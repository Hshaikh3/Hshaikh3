## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Hshaikh3/Hshaikh3** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi, I’m Hadi Shaikh. I’m an Information Technology student at the University of Central Florida with a strong interest in cybersecurity and protecting systems and data. 
I currently work full-time as an IT Specialist at House Call MDs, a healthcare provider, where I apply and continue building my technical skills every day. 
I’ve also interned with Hensel Phelps, gaining hands-on experience working with IT and network teams to support enterprise infrastructure. 
Through these roles, I’ve built a solid foundation in IT operations, networking, cybersecurity, and cloud fundamentals, supported by my CompTIA Security+ and AZ-900 certifications.
I’m driven by curiosity, enjoy learning through hands-on work, and aim to keep growing in cybersecurity while making a real-world impact.
